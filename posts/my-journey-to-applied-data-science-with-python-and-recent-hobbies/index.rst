Online Course
-------------

I'm doing Applied Data Science courses on Coursera. I finally paid my tuition after Coursera limited assessed participation to only paid users. After successfully completing the first course, I made the jump. 

I was a bit more skillful in the second course. For a start, I passed it with a first try and I also know more ways to get help I need. I have a feeling it's not as "hard" as the first course - Introduction to Data Science in Python (mainly pandas). But it's a false perception. I did spend a lot of time getting my way around knowing stackoverflow, Dash and online documentations, Jupyter notebook and good books/videos on Safarionline.

My second course, Applied Plotting, Charting & Data Representation in Python, still need my Pandas skill, but the main focus in on evaluation of a good chart, Matplotlib and a little bit of seaborn. I find the introduction to Seaborn very limited and I wish Bokeh was included. We have an assignment where I created a semi-interaction chart, it was a pain to do that in Matplotlib. I believe it will be easier with Bokeh but I haven't learnt it so we will see later.

At the beginning, I thought talking about chartjunk and how to evaluate charts is a bit airy fairy but later into the course, when I peer-assessed other classmates' work, I noticed that people tended to focus a lot on the programming techniques and still did not take in the advice from the Principles of Information Visualization. Then I realised how important it is. 

Study Statistics
----------------

In this course, I find myself limited by my statistcal knowledge and I barely try to analyse data in that way. So I'm going to catch up now. Also, I'm a bit scared by the next course Applied Machine Learning in Python.

I find this interesting book on Safarionline, `Practical Statistics for Data Scientists <https://www.safaribooksonline.com/library/view/practical-statistics-for/9781491952955/>`_. It seems readable for my level but unfortunately, its code is in R. I plan to converse it and share here: https://github.com/jeremy886/learn-stats

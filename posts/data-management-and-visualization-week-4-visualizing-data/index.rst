Finally, I have learnt a lot about seaborn and explore my data with the help of data visualization.

I tried several plots provided by seaborn. I liked its simplicity and power in data visualization and I used 
techniques taught in the lecture video but I feel it's not enough and I ended up spending a lot more time to
figure out all the details.

In 4 weeks, I partially answered my question but it's not very satisfactory. More can be learnt in the area of
data visualization and statistics. 

Here is my week 4 assignment done in Jupyter-notebook. **You need to click this link so you can follow along.**

I was not motivated enough to jump into the Data Science world and now back to teaching in a regional town for nearly 9 months (school holidays in-between). I am teaching Y11 General Maths and using the very basic Least Squares Regression Line.

I guess I should use more of my data skills in teaching. For example, we may have a new subject titled Data Analysis next year and I am considering taking a course, Introduction to Data Wise: A Collaborative Process to Improve Learning & Teaching, on Edx and then move into a different position.

Anyway, my goal is to bring something new to this regional town in the middle of nowhere. I saw one university is offering a free loan for AR/AI kits if I complete their traning course. I probably will bite the bullet and do it.

That's the updates. Until next time...

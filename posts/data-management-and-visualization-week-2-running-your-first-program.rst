Here is my work.

Thoughts
========

I spent a lot of time creating workable data from the 2016 census files. I learnt a lot but it's also very time consuming. 

I also chose to use Jupyter-notebook this time instead of Spyder. It's simply a lot easier to explore data and ideas in Jupyter. I will also present my assignment in Jupyter. You can read me comments and programs over there.

Assignment 2: Jupyter-notebook_.

Thank you for your time and feedback.
